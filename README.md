# Tic Tac Toe
This is my implimentation of [Free Code Camp's](www.freecodecamp.com)

## Improvement Opportunities
 * The second answer on [this page](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-never-lose-at-Tic-Tac-Toe)
 apparently shows how to never lose. That doesn't really seem like fun (always losing or tying if you're the player),
 so for now the computer will just play randomly. If I do implement some sort of strategy, it might be something like
 playing following the "never lose" strategy, but make a random move 5% of the time. This way an astute player will actually
 come out on top over time. That assumes there is somebody who wants to be an astute, long-term tic tac toe player, so I'll likely never do this.
 * [This guy](https://codepen.io/daniel-m/pen/vXRyKk) has implemented a version that draws imperfect lines and letters on a chalkboard, so that it actually appears hand-written. This is sexy and a strategy that I could use for my pencil on paper design if I want to improve the style.
